Works a bit differently than the usual version.


The different rules :

1. When you shift a row with two or more adjacent numbers, only the last number is shifted.
    For example,
      on moving 2 4 8 0 to right, it becomes 2 4 0 8 and NOT 0 2 4 8 (as in the usual version)

2. You only get '2' as new additions. (4 does not appear randomly, unlike the usual version)

3. Upon shifting a row with elements that can be combined, maximum combination takes place.
    For example, 
      on moving 2 2 4 0 to right, you get 0 0 0 8 and NOT 0 0 4 4 (as in the usual version)
